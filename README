Steamodd is a project that grew out of a 200 line test script I
wrote to test out the new API and find stuff I could complain about.

There are still some hacky spots but overall the modules should be
usable in a project. End-users may be interested in the backpack viewer
script found in this directory.


I'm including my API key here mostly because I don't feel like rewriting the
commit history to remove it and it shouldn't be that big of a deal if you're
testing, however I ask that you use your own key if you're planning on using
steamodd regularly. Especially if you're writing your own stuff that uses
steamodd.

Change the key by editing steam/__init__.py or setting steam.api_key at runtime
before anything is instantiated.

You can also set the language steamodd passes in API requests that support it by
setting steam.language which is en (English) by default. See the docstrings for
further info.
