Steamodd is a project that grew out of a 200 line test script I
wrote to test out the new API and find stuff I could complain about.

There are still some hacky spots but overall the modules should be
usable in a project. End-users may be interested in the backpack viewer
script found in this directory.

Be sure to set your api key and language before using any of the module functions.
It can be defined in the core config file which is currently in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/
steammod.rc.d/core.js in GNU/Linux systems and %APPDATA%/steammod/steammod.rc.d/core.js
on Windows.

You can also set it directly by assigning to steam.api_key and steam.language.

If you don't have an API key it's easy to register for one at
